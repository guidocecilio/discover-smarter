Three former executives of Anglo Irish Bank were charged in July 2012 with unlawfully helping a group of investors to buy shares in the lender in 2008, falsely inflating the share price before the bank was nationalised in 2009.
The bank later collapsed, a key reason Dublin was forced to accept a €67.5bn bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund.

As Enda Kenny, the prime minister, announces an inquiry into the bank’s collapse following the release of taped conversations between Anglo Irish executives, the Financial Times looks at the men behind the scandal that Ireland’s opposition has described as “shocking to the core”.
Sean Fitzpatrick
The former chief executive and chairman of Anglo Irish was arrested at Dublin airport in July and is to go on trial at the start of 2014 over his alleged role in the failure of the financial institution. He faces 16 charges.
Once a multimillionaire and a leading light of the Republic of Ireland’s Celtic Tiger economy, Mr Fitzpatrick was at the helm of Anglo Irish for 20 years.
After an early stint in chartered accountancy, Mr Fitzpatrick took over as chief executive of what was then the City of Dublin Bank in 1986.
At the time, the bank was a tiny operation with eight staff and net worth of just €5m, but over the next 18 years, Mr Fitzpatrick transformed the small commercial bank into an aggressive lender to property developers by injecting tens of millions of euros into projects in Ireland, the UK and other countries.

- Sean Fitzpatrick, in an interview in 2008, shortly after the Irish state issued the bank guarantee
Anglo Irish’s share price soared from less than €1 to hit €17.60 in May 2007, valuing it at €13bn and helping to make Mr Fitzpatrick one of Ireland’s most influential business leaders.
By 2007, Mr Fitzpatrick was one of Ireland’s richest men, with a fortune estimated at €89m by The Sunday Times Rich List.
Dublin plans Anglo Irish public inquiry

Dublin aims to set up a public inquiry into the banking crash in the autumn in response to deep public anger caused by the broadcast of taped phone calls suggesting Anglo Irish Bank deliberately misled the previous government into supporting the lender during the financial crisis, writes Jamie Smyth.
“I think we should spend the summer getting all the detail in place, getting the scoping done and all the regulations in place so we can embark on a proper inquiry early in the next Dáil [parliamentary] term,” said Brendan Howlin, Ireland’s minister for public expenditure on Tuesday.

Known as “Seanie”, the 64-year-old golf fanatic lives in the upmarket Co Wicklow suburb of Greystones with his wife Triona and two children.
He enjoyed senior political connections – most famously he played a round of golf with former Irish prime minister Brian Cowen a few months before the state issued a bank guarantee that temporarily saved Anglo Irish from collapse. This disclosure led to Mr Cowen’s downfall in early 2011.
Mr Fitzpatrick’s fortunes changed when Ireland’s property bubble burst, leading investors to question the health of Ireland’s entire banking system.
He stepped down from Anglo Irish in December 2008 after admitting he had not disclosed to shareholders €87m of personal borrowings he had obtained from the bank between 2000 and 2007.
Anglo Irish was subsequently nationalised and rebranded the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation with its collapse costing Irish taxpayers about €30bn.
Mr Fitzpatrick was declared bankrupt in July 2010, with a monthly income of €188, according to legal documents.
David Drumm
The former chief executive of Anglo Irish, Mr Drumm has not yet faced any criminal charges in relation to the lender’s collapse. His bankruptcy trial may not be held until 2014 because of complex talks surrounding the legal exchange of documents.
The 46-year-old son of a truck driver, Mr Drumm left school at 16 with a high school diploma and a determination to make money.
One of eight children, Mr Drumm turned down a place at university to join a small accountancy practice as an apprentice before joining Deloitte where he trained as an accountant.
He qualified after four years and worked at a small venture capital company based in Dundalk, where he assessed applications for funding and sat on company boards.
After a brief stint at another accountancy firm, he joined Anglo Irish in 1993 as an assistant manager, taking a 40 per cent pay cut.
Five years later, Mr Fitzpatrick sent Mr Drumm – then aged just 35 years – to Boston, Massachusetts, to establish the bank’s US business.
So f***in’ what. Just take it anyway . . .stick the fingers up
- David Drumm to John Bowe, head of capital markets at Anglo Irish, as they laugh off concerns expressed by Irish regulators and EU governments that they were abusing the bank guarantee by using it to lure deposits from the UK and Germany
The banker was chosen to replace Mr Fitzpatrick as chief executive in 2005 and boasted that he would double the bank’s profits in five years. He achieved it in two.
Anglo Irish paid Mr Drumm €4.65m in 2007 and €2.1m in 2008.
He resigned in 2008 and a year later, Anglo Irish began a case to recover loans of more than €8m it made to him. The bank also began a separate case against Mr Drumm and his wife, Lorraine over the transfer of a €2.3m house in Malahide, Co Dublin, into the sole name of Mrs Drumm. The transfer has been reversed.
Just three weeks before the government guarantee of Irish bank liabilities that saddled taxpayers with billions of euros in debt, Mr Drumm instructed 600 staff to celebrate in style at the Mansion House in Dublin.
“This is Anglo, so there is only one thing to do – party!” Mr Drumm wrote in an email to staff.
He filed for bankruptcy in October 2010 in Massachusetts, after failing to reach a settlement with Anglo Irish over a debt of more than €8.5m, most of which was borrowed to buy shares in the bank.
Mr Drumm filed details of his assets and liabilities – which he stated as between $1m and $10m in a court document – including a Mercedes sedan and SUV. His $4.6m home in Cape Cod was sold to pay toward his debts.
Mr Drumm has refused to return to Ireland to co-operate with investigations into practices at Anglo Irish.
Willie McAteer
The former finance director and chief risk officer of Anglo Irish is charged with giving unlawful financial assistance in connection with the purchase of Anglo Irish shares to 16 people in July 2008.
Originally from Donegal, Mr McAteer, a chartered accountant, joined Anglo Irish as finance director in June 1992 after working at the financial company Yeoman International Leasing, where he was managing director.
The quietly spoken 61-year-old was finance director of Anglo Irish when the government introduced the bank guarantee in September 2008 and when the bank was nationalised in January 2009. He also held the position of chief risk officer at the time.
Mr McAteer, who lives in a luxurious home in the upmarket suburb of Rathgar, South Dublin, was paid €660,000 by Anglo Irish in the financial year to September 2008, his final full year at the bank, and €1.4m the previous year.
Mr McAteer had €3.5m worth of shares in Anglo Irish at the end of 2008 – more than any other board member, with the exception of Mr Fitzpatrick. He was given a non-recourse loan of €8m by Anglo Irish earlier in 2008 so he could pay off another loan without cashing in shares.
He was involved in a root-and-branch trawl through Anglo Irish’s loan book in late 2008 – months after the state’s guarantee of the bank – but wrongly predicted just €2.76bn of loans would be needed to be written off over three years.
Pat Whelan
The former managing director of Anglo Irish’s lending business and a one-time director of the bank was charged with 16 offences related to financial irregularities at the lender in July 2012.
Mr Whelan joined Anglo Irish in 1989 and worked his way up through the bank to join the board in 2006.
He was appointed managing director of the bank’s main business in Ireland in 2007, having previously been a director of group risk and operations. Anglo Irish’s 2008 annual report shows €42.8bn of the bank’s €73.2bn loan book comprised loans advanced in Ireland.
The 50-year-old was a member of Anglo Irish’s senior executive board and worked closely with Mr Drumm, then chief executive.
He was paid €650,000 by Anglo Irish in the bank’s financial year to September 2008 and €1.2m the previous year, including a bonus of €640,000.
Mr Whelan resigned as an executive director of the bank in February 2009, one month after Anglo Irish was nationalised by the government.
However, he remained working at the bank under the new management team led by Mr Fitzpatrick’s successor, Donal O’Connor, and finally left the lender in December 2009.
In the 15 months to the end of 2009 Mr Whelan was paid €277,000. The bank’s annual report shows he owed the Anglo Irish €5.8m in personal loans at the end of 2009.
After leaving Anglo Irish, Mr Whelan, who lives in the Dublin suburb of Malahide, joined an accountancy and financial services consultancy in south Dublin before pursuing other business interests.
John Bowe
Mr Bowe joined Anglo Irish in 2001 and held a number of senior treasury positions, including head of wholesale funding, before being promoted to head of capital markets in September 2008, in charge of wholesale funding.
He was later elevated to director of corporate development and was involved in Anglo’s efforts to collect debts owed by the family of Sean Quinn, formerly Ireland’s richest man.
Since leaving Anglo Irish in March 2012, Mr Bowe has founded his own consultancy firm, Independent Consultant, which works with accountancy practices on client engagements in the leisure and healthcare sectors. He has extensive experience in the shipping industry and has been a director of Maersk Equipment Service since June 20 2012.
Just, as Drummer [David Drumm, former chief executive] would say, ‘picked it out of my arse’
- John Bowe, when asked by Peter Fitzgerald, director of retail banking at Anglo Irish, how the bank arrived at a figure of €7bn in its request for bridging finance from the central bank
His LinkedIn site described Mr Bowe as having experience at a senior level in banking and corporate restructuring and cites his “excellent commercial, analytical, team building and crisis management skills”. His profile was removed on Tuesday.
Following the broadcast of the tapes, Mr Bowe has categorically denied he was party to any attempt to mislead the Central Bank of Ireland. He said with hindsight he deeply regretted the language and tone he used in the phone conversations, which he said were imprudent and inappropriate.
